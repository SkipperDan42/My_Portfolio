This will print out the DNA Sequence.
The function automatically formats the output to have hyphens between each
gene and encoding.
-   The function can be asked to print with colour by passing the parameter 
    True.
-   The function can additionally show (in colour) whether the gene is
    present in the mother or father gene by passing all 4 of the parent
    chromosomes in a list as a parameter.

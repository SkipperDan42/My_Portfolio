Reception,1,0,This is the school's reception. Broken glass and paper covers the floor
Hallway,1,1,You enter the main hallway. It is pitch black. There are no windows at all.
DT Room,2,1,You are in the school's workshop. Splintered wood and rusted metal lay dormant on shelves. There is a suspicious lack of power tools.
Cafeteria,0,1,You stand in the school cafeteria. Try as you might there are no turkey twizzlers to be found. Absolute shambles tbh.
Science Lab,1,2,The school science lab is full of foul smelling chemicals and thriving agar cultures. A dead calf floats idly in a jar of formaldhyde.

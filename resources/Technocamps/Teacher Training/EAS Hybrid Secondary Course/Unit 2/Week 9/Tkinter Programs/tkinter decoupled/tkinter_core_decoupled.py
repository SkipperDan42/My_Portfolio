# OKAY - so basically, lambda functions don't truly return the values when
# called. So when we changed the value of totalSales it wouldn't update as
# it hadn't changed in tk_core() [or rather tk_main() in your versions]
#
# HOWEVER - by changing our lambda function to run this IF the other function
# is true, suddenly we can return the values (as they are and always were 
# in scope).
#
# DON'T worry too much about this, this is way out of scope of GCSE and
# honestly is EXACTLY why you use Object Oriented for this sort of thing.
# It is genuinely far easier to use global variables in these situatuations!
